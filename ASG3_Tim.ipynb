You have not learned your lesson yet.”\\r\\n', '\\r\\n', 'Mother Reindeer had intended to take a nap, but she had many things\\r\\n', 'to think of after White Sox left her. Uncle Slim had told them that\\r\\n', 'probably the big herd would be pastured on the ice-coated sea beach\\r\\n', 'during the coming winter. This meant that the sled deer would grow very\\r\\n', 'thin again. The herders liked to pasture the herd there so that they\\r\\n', 'could live in their old sod houses and be near the big village at Point\\r\\n', 'Barrow.\\r\\n', '\\r\\n', 'Lack of moss would not be the only drawback; there was also the terror\\r\\n', 'of the Eskimo dogs. Slim’s brother had been crippled by a malamute\\r\\n', 'dog, at Kivalina, when hauling mail on the Barrow-Kotzebue route.\\r\\n', 'Last December, Slim and five other reindeer had been staked out for\\r\\n', 'five nights near Point Barrow village. They were exposed to a fierce\\r\\n', 'northeast wind while the drivers were enjoying themselves in the\\r\\n', 'village, where feasting and dancing were going on. On the fifth night\\r\\n', 'the wind had changed to the northwest, and the reindeer had been\\r\\n', 'scented by hungry village dogs. After a desperate struggle, Slim and\\r\\n', 'the other reindeer had broken their tethers and had outrun the dogs.\\r\\n', 'They had run miles and miles back to the big herd, and so had saved\\r\\n', 'their lives.\\r\\n', '\\r\\n', 'It was not all joy in the big herd. Mother Reindeer knew that very\\r\\n', 'well. Many a time she too had been tempted to stay with her caribou\\r\\n', 'cousins and adopt their free life.

Did you think it right?”\\r\\n', '\\r\\n', 'Mother Reindeer did not speak, but she nodded her head upward and\\r\\n', 'downward, very slowly.\\r\\n', '\\r\\n', '“They killed two of my uncles also,” continued White Sox, “but they\\r\\n', 'never touched my sisters or my aunts.

He looked sadly at his dark stockings, which\\r\\n', 'were almost as black as the feathers of a raven; but he answered\\r\\n', 'thoughtfully: “I am thankful my nose is still white.

I want to hear the story of how the\\r\\n', 'first caribou was tamed, mother.”\\r\\n', '\\r\\n', 'This pleased Mother Reindeer very much. “Good, my son!” she said. “Now\\r\\n', 'for the story!”\\r\\n', '\\r\\n', 'And under the bright arctic moon, on the very top of the great American\\r\\n', 'continent, she told him the story.\\r\\n', '\\r\\n', '\\r\\n', '\\r\\n', '\\r\\n', '[Illustration: “‘He was the first caribou that ever had any white\\r\\n', 'markings.’”]\\r\\n', '\\r\\n', '\\r\\n', '\\r\\n', '\\r\\n', 'VII\\r\\n', '\\r\\n', 'MOTHER REINDEER’S STORY OF WHITE FEET\\r\\n', '\\r\\n', '\\r\\n', '“Ever and ever so long ago, on a fine summer day, a great herd of wild\\r\\n', 'caribou was browsing near the seashore,” said Mother Reindeer. “This\\r\\n', 'shore was far away toward the setting sun, across the great piece of\\r\\n', 'water. There were no reindeer at the time of which I am speaking. This\\r\\n', 'herd of caribou was more than ten times as large as our own big herd.\\r\\n', 'There were so many of them, and they were so strong, that they had\\r\\n', 'grown careless.\\r\\n', '\\r\\n', '“Wolves did not usually bother the caribou in summer. There had been no\\r\\n', 'hunters chasing them for a long time. The great herd felt quite safe.\\r\\n', 'It was their custom to keep a few hundred of their swiftest runners on\\r\\n', 'picket duty all around the herd, to watch for enemies. But, as I have\\r\\n', 'just told you, they had grown careless.\\r\\n', '\\r\\n', '“In this great herd of wild caribou was a fawn with white legs and\\r\\n', 'white nose. He was the first caribou that ever had any white markings.\\r\\n', 'All the others were very proud of him. They named him ‘White Feet.’”\\r\\n', '\\r\\n', '“Did I look like him, mother?” asked White Sox, who was much interested\\r\\n', 'in the story.\\r\\n', '\\r\\n', '“Yes, indeed! You were exactly like him in every way, my son,” said\\r\\n', 'Mother Reindeer, proudly. “The fame of this first marked fawn spread\\r\\n', 'far and wide. Many other bands of caribou came to see him. They all\\r\\n', 'agreed that he was born to be king of the caribou. So much attention\\r\\n', 'caused his mother to be very careful to train him in the right way. He\\r\\n', 'had many, many things to learn.”\\r\\n', '\\r\\n', '“Yes, mother. A fawn who is going to be a great leader must know more\\r\\n', 'than the other reindeer fawns,” said White Sox.\\r\\n', '\\r\\n', 'Mother Reindeer was much pleased at the interest her son was taking\\r\\n', 'in the story. “That is very true,” she said. “White Feet was very\\r\\n', 'observing and thoughtful. He became wise while he was a fawn. He\\r\\n', 'remembered what his mother told him. He often thought about it and\\r\\n', 'planned what he would do when he grew up to be the leader.\\r\\n', '\\r\\n', '“Now, as I told you before, this great herd of wild caribou felt a\\r\\n', 'little too safe. One fine summer day, when they were grazing near the\\r\\n', 'shore, a large band of hungry wolves scented them. These crafty enemies\\r\\n', 'came nearer and nearer without the herd’s knowing anything about them.\\r\\n', 'At last, when they thought they were close enough, out they rushed. The\\r\\n', 'terrified herd of caribou stampeded pell-mell into the icy water of the\\r\\n', 'Arctic Ocean.”\\r\\n', '\\r\\n', '“Oh!” gasped White Sox. “Did the wolves get many of them?”\\r\\n', '\\r\\n', '“Wait and listen,” said Mother Reindeer.\\r\\n', '\\r\\n', '“White Feet and six other young fawns who always followed him had gone\\r\\n', 'up on a hill to the right of the great herd. They were not caught in\\r\\n', 'the stampede, but they were cut off from the herd. A large band of\\r\\n', 'fierce wolves was between them and the caribou. All the fawns except\\r\\n', 'young White Feet were very much frightened. They began to ‘mill,’ or\\r\\n', 'run around in a circle. White Feet remembered what his mother had\\r\\n', 'told him about wolves. He was only half your age, but he took command\\r\\n', 'of the little band of fawns and led them down the other side of the\\r\\n', 'hill, across a narrow valley, and then up the side of a high ridge.\\r\\n', 'He planned to get over the summit and out of sight before any of the\\r\\n', 'wolves began to look for stragglers.\\r\\n', '\\r\\n', '“When they reached the top of the ridge, they could see the herd\\r\\n', 'swimming about in the water. The many antlers looked like a great mass\\r\\n', 'of brushwood afloat. And they could see the wolves pacing up and down\\r\\n', 'along the shore, either too cowardly or too wise to follow the caribou\\r\\n', 'into the water.\\r\\n', '\\r\\n', '“The fawns stood on the high ridge, their mouths wide open. Great drops\\r\\n', 'of perspiration fell from their lolling tongues. Young White Feet was\\r\\n', 'wondering how long the wolves would keep the caribou in the icy water,\\r\\n', 'and how he could lead his little band back to their mothers. He looked\\r\\n', 'all about him, this way and that, and what do you think he saw?\\r\\n', '\\r\\n', '“Three big gray wolves were creeping up the side of the ridge, coming\\r\\n', 'straight toward him and the fawns.”\\r\\n', '\\r\\n', '“Oh!” cried White Sox, greatly excited. “What did he do, mother?”\\r\\n', '\\r\\n', '“He told the fawns to follow him and to do just as he did,” said Mother\\r\\n', 'Reindeer. “He had seen a small bay farther along the beach. It was made\\r\\n', 'by a long, narrow spit of land that curved like the main branch of my\\r\\n', 'antlers. ‘Come on!’ he cried. ‘It’s a race for life to that little bay\\r\\n', 'down yonder.’\\r\\n', '\\r\\n', '“Then away he went, with the other six fawns at his heels. Down, down,\\r\\n', 'down toward the bay they raced. When they were about halfway there,\\r\\n', 'White Feet saw smoke ahead. It was coming from a skin tent that lay\\r\\n', 'between them and the bay.”\\r\\n', '\\r\\n', '[Illustration: “‘Then, just as the first wolf was about to seize the\\r\\n', 'hindermost fawn, he and his little band swerved to one side and burst\\r\\n', 'into the big tent.’”]\\r\\n', '\\r\\n', '“Oh, a herder’s tent!” cried White Sox.\\r\\n', '\\r\\n', '“No, indeed!” said Mother Reindeer. “There were no herders in those\\r\\n', 'days, my son. It was the tent of a hunter. White Feet didn’t know which\\r\\n', 'was the more to be feared, a wolf or a hunter. Both were the enemies of\\r\\n', 'the caribou. And the little band of fawns were depending on him to lead\\r\\n', 'them to safety.”\\r\\n', '\\r\\n', '“I understand,” said White Sox. “A leader must decide things for\\r\\n', 'himself, and do it quickly. He can’t ask his mother every time he faces\\r\\n', 'a duty.”\\r\\n', '\\r\\n', '“Yes,” said Mother Reindeer, “and the three gray wolves forced White\\r\\n', 'Feet to decide quickly this time. They were coming down the slope\\r\\n', 'behind the fawns. White Feet knew that the wolves were gaining on\\r\\n', 'them, but as he looked ahead, he saw that the tent flap was open. He\\r\\n', 'felt quite sure that his little band could not reach the bay, and he\\r\\n', 'had been told that wolves would avoid a hunter’s tent in daylight. But\\r\\n', 'these beasts thought they were surely going to have a big feed of fawn\\r\\n', 'meat.\\r\\n', '\\r\\n', '“White Feet shouted to his followers to turn and dash into the tent.\\r\\n', 'Then, just as the first wolf was about to seize the hindermost fawn, he\\r\\n', 'and his little band swerved to one side and burst into the big tent.\\r\\n', '\\r\\n', '“Whiz! whiz! whiz!\\r\\n', '\\r\\n', '“The native hunter, all unknown to the fawns and wolves, had been\\r\\n', 'watching the race from behind the tent. Three gray wolves now lay on\\r\\n', 'the ground outside, pinned fast by the hunter’s terrible arrows.”\\r\\n', '\\r\\n', '“Oh, mother, mother!” cried White Sox, who was trembling with\\r\\n', 'excitement. “Did the hunter kill White Feet and his six fawns?”\\r\\n', '\\r\\n', 'Mother Reindeer looked at her son for a moment in silence and then\\r\\n', 'continued her story.\\r\\n', '\\r\\n', '\\r\\n', '\\r\\n', '\\r\\n', '[Illustration: “‘A woman and her three children squatted near the\\r\\n', 'fire.’”]\\r\\n', '\\r\\n', '\\r\\n', '\\r\\n', '\\r\\n', 'VIII\\r\\n', '\\r\\n', 'THE FIRST HUMAN FRIEND\\r\\n', '\\r\\n', '\\r\\n', '“Inside the big tent,” Mother Reindeer went on, “a woman and her three\\r\\n', 'children squatted near the fire. They were eating a freshly cooked\\r\\n', 'duck. They were so taken by surprise when the little band of caribou\\r\\n', 'fawns dashed in through their open tent flap that at first they could\\r\\n', 'not speak or move. Then the mother sprang up and fastened the tent flap\\r\\n', 'tight.\\r\\n', '\\r\\n', '“White Feet and his followers had come to a stop at the farther side of\\r\\n', 'the tent. They stood bunched together, with heads erect. All but White\\r\\n', 'Feet were shaking with fear. They had seen the woman close the tent\\r\\n', 'flap. They knew that they were prisoners now, and they thought that\\r\\n', 'they had escaped one death only to meet another. Then they saw the tent\\r\\n', 'flap open a little way. The hunter peeped in; then he opened it wider,\\r\\n', 'slipped inside the tent, and closed the flap quickly.\\r\\n', '\\r\\n', '“White Feet noticed that the hunter carried his big bow in his hand. He\\r\\n', 'noticed also that he and his family all wore clothes made of caribou\\r\\n', 'skins. They spoke to each other in strange sounds such as the fawns\\r\\n', 'had never before heard. They all appeared to be very much excited and\\r\\n', 'pleased. They looked at the fawns, and the fawns looked at them.\\r\\n', '\\r\\n', '“Suddenly the bigger boy gave a loud cry and pointed at White Feet. The\\r\\n', 'hunter and the others looked at White Feet, too. Then they talked in\\r\\n', 'excited tones.\\r\\n', '\\r\\n', '“White Feet, of course, didn’t know what they were saying, but he felt\\r\\n', 'quite sure that they were talking about his white markings. Oh, how he\\r\\n', 'wished his mother had been with him! Then he remembered that a leader\\r\\n', 'must not think of himself when others depend on him. Here were the six\\r\\n', 'poor little fawns scared half to death, and he had promised to take\\r\\n', 'care of them. What should he do?\\r\\n', '\\r\\n', '“He looked at the bigger boy, and the bigger boy looked at him. There\\r\\n', 'was something in the boy’s eyes that gave White Feet courage. He didn’t\\r\\n', 'seem like an enemy. He stood near his father, but his head came only\\r\\n', 'as high as the hunter’s elbow.\\r\\n', '\\r\\n', '“White Feet made up his mind to trust this boy. Then he did the boldest\\r\\n', 'thing ever done by a caribou. He walked across the tent to where the\\r\\n', 'bigger boy stood and rubbed his head against the boy’s arm.”\\r\\n', '\\r\\n', '“Oh!” gasped White Sox. “How brave he was!”\\r\\n', '\\r\\n', '“Yes,” said Mother Reindeer, “that little caribou fawn was the first of\\r\\n', 'his kind to try to make friends with an enemy. Of course the boy was\\r\\n', 'surprised. He touched White Feet on the head. He spoke kindly to him\\r\\n', 'and patted his shoulder. All the others stopped talking and watched\\r\\n', 'them.\\r\\n', '\\r\\n', '“The bigger boy stooped down and stroked White Feet’s beautiful\\r\\n', 'stockings. White Feet rubbed his head against the boy’s arm again and\\r\\n', 'tried to tell him how much he wanted him for a friend.\\r\\n', '\\r\\n', '“The boy’s young sister wanted to touch the fawn’s pretty stockings.\\r\\n', 'She was a little bit afraid. She moved close beside the bigger boy, put\\r\\n', 'out her hand very carefully, and just touched the top of the nearest\\r\\n', 'white stocking. Then she laughed, and the two boys laughed, and their\\r\\n', 'mother laughed. And what do you think White Feet did?\\r\\n', '\\r\\n', '“_He kissed that little girl._ Yes, he did—right on the cheek. He\\r\\n', 'licked her cheek with his warm tongue.\\r\\n', '\\r\\n', '“The little girl wasn’t a bit afraid of him after that. She stroked his\\r\\n', 'white stockings, talked baby talk to him, and then she put her arms\\r\\n', 'about his neck and loved him.\\r\\n', '\\r\\n', '“White Feet felt pretty sure that the children would not let the hunter\\r\\n', 'kill him—just then. But he had to think for Blackie—the other male fawn\\r\\n', 'of his little band—and the five does. He told Blackie and the doe fawns\\r\\n', 'to make friends with the other boy and his mother. At first they were\\r\\n', 'too scared to move, but at last poor Blackie got courage enough to walk\\r\\n', 'up to the younger boy and rub his head against his arm. This seemed to\\r\\n', 'please the younger boy very much. Before long all the doe fawns had\\r\\n', 'followed his example, and the human beings were laughing and talking\\r\\n', 'kindly to them.\\r\\n', '\\r\\n', '“The hunter had been shaking his head, but now he nodded it upward and\\r\\n', 'downward. White Feet felt sure that he was saying ‘yes’ to what the\\r\\n', 'children had been asking, and that none of the little band would be\\r\\n', 'killed at once. White Feet watched the hunter very carefully, but he\\r\\n', 'kept close to the bigger boy because the boy was his first friend.\\r\\n', '\\r\\n', '“After a little while the hunter made two small halters of sealskin\\r\\n', 'rope. He put one over White Feet’s head and the other over Blackie’s.\\r\\n', 'Then the bigger boy led White Feet out of the tent and on to the narrow\\r\\n', 'spit. The younger boy led Blackie. The five doe fawns followed them,\\r\\n', 'and so did the little girl and her mother and father.\\r\\n', '\\r\\n', '[Illustration: “‘Dainten and White Feet loved each other.’”]\\r\\n', '\\r\\n', '“When they were all far out on the spit, the hunter stretched his fish\\r\\n', 'net across the narrow neck of ground. White Feet and his band were now\\r\\n', 'prisoners on the spit. They were very glad to be alive and safe from\\r\\n', 'the wolves. They didn’t know how long the hunter would let them live,\\r\\n', 'and oh! how they did want their mothers! But they were very hungry too,\\r\\n', 'and when White Feet saw some nice grass and scrubby willows, you may be\\r\\n', 'quite sure that the little band forgot their troubles and ate a good\\r\\n', 'supper.\\r\\n', '\\r\\n', '“Afterward White Feet examined the long, narrow spit. It was low and\\r\\n', 'rolling, and most of it was covered with moss and grass. There were\\r\\n', 'dwarf willows too, and along its western shore, under a long bluff,\\r\\n', 'was a level drift of old winter snow. The place looked mighty good to\\r\\n', 'White Feet, especially when he found that the children were going to\\r\\n', 'live on the sand spit with them. That very night the hunter and his\\r\\n', 'family moved their tent inside the fish-net corral. The little band of\\r\\n', 'fawns had a long sleep in perfect safety.\\r\\n', '\\r\\n', '“Next day the hunter and his wife stood and watched the fawns play with\\r\\n', 'the children. The hunter seemed to be most interested in White Feet.\\r\\n', 'When he spoke to him, White Feet would go right up to the hunter and\\r\\n', 'rub his head against the man’s arm or leg. You see, White Feet had\\r\\n', 'thought it all out and decided that the band must have the hunter for a\\r\\n', 'friend; then their lives would be safe. But of course the hunter didn’t\\r\\n', 'know that. He was very much puzzled. He stared at White Feet and talked\\r\\n', 'to him as if the fawn with the unheard-of markings were the returned\\r\\n', 'spirit of his dead father, who had been a chief and a mighty hunter.\\r\\n', 'After a few days the hunter went away.\\r\\n', '\\r\\n', '“The captive fawns soon forgot their sorrow and fear. The spit was a\\r\\n', 'safe home. They had a variety of forage and plenty of it. They had\\r\\n', 'loving companions. They could sleep soundly without fear of enemies. It\\r\\n', 'was a new life to them and they liked it.\\r\\n', '\\r\\n', '“The bigger boy’s name was Dainten. White Feet soon discovered that.\\r\\n', 'The two were together nearly all the time. They loved each other.\\r\\n', '\\r\\n', '“But White Feet always remembered that the hunter and his family\\r\\n', 'dressed in caribou skins. This made him very thoughtful. He felt quite\\r\\n', 'sure that if all his followers were allowed to live and grow up, they\\r\\n', 'must find a way to be of use to the hunter.”\\r\\n', '\\r\\n', '\\r\\n', '\\r\\n', '\\r\\n', '[Illustration: “White Feet smelled at them, but he couldn’t make out\\r\\n', 'what Dainten intended to do.”]\\r\\n', '\\r\\n', '\\r\\n', '\\r\\n', '\\r\\n', 'IX\\r\\n', '\\r\\n', 'WHITE FEET FINDS A WAY OF SERVING MAN\\r\\n', '\\r\\n', '\\r\\n', '“One day,” continued Mother Reindeer, “some driftwood was washed up by\\r\\n', 'the sea. Dainten pulled the pieces up on the beach. He found two that\\r\\n', 'were crooked near the end. These pieces were of the same length, and\\r\\n', 'the crooked ends were bent in about the same way.\\r\\n', '\\r\\n', '“White Feet smelled at them, but he couldn’t make out what Dainten\\r\\n', 'intended to do as he watched him place the two pieces side by side,\\r\\n', 'a short distance apart. Dainten then took some shorter pieces of\\r\\n', 'driftwood, placed them crosswise on the others, and lashed them fast\\r\\n', 'with sealskin thongs. It was a strange-looking thing he had made. The\\r\\n', 'crooked ends bent upward. To the crosspiece nearest these he fastened\\r\\n', 'a stout rope of sealskin thongs. He then placed his little sister and\\r\\n', 'brother on the thing and pulled them over the snow.”\\r\\n', '\\r\\n', '“I know!” exclaimed White Sox, quickly. “That was a sled.”\\r\\n', '\\r\\n', '“It was,” said Mother Reindeer. “White Feet stood and watched them use\\r\\n', 'the sled. He was doing some hard thinking. He wanted to do everything\\r\\n', 'he saw Dainten do. When the bigger boy had given his little brother and\\r\\n', 'sister one ride, White Feet asked Dainten to let him draw the sled. Of\\r\\n', 'course Dainten didn’t know what White Feet was saying; but when White\\r\\n', 'Feet put his neck under the rope and tried to take his place in front\\r\\n', 'of the sled, Dainten began to understand.\\r\\n', '\\r\\n', '“He laughed and patted White Feet. He put the rope around his neck and\\r\\n', 'tied it so it would not slip and choke him. Then he tied a small piece\\r\\n', 'of rope to the right side of the halter band that White Feet was still\\r\\n', 'wearing, and another piece to the left side. It was the hour after\\r\\n', 'sunset. The snow, which had been soft and mushy at noon, was now hard\\r\\n', 'and crusted.\\r\\n', '\\r\\n', '[Illustration: “‘To prevent its running against his heels, he swerved\\r\\n', 'to the left, giving the riders a great spill.’”]\\r\\n', '\\r\\n', '“Dainten took his place on the front end of the sled and held the lines\\r\\n', 'in his hands. His sister and brother sat behind him. When all was\\r\\n', 'ready, he gave a slap of the lines on the fawn’s sides. White Feet\\r\\n', 'understood. He started very slowly and carefully, but he found that the\\r\\n', 'loaded sled was easy to draw over the trail of hard snow. When Dainten\\r\\n', 'urged him to go faster, he broke into a trot. All the other fawns\\r\\n', 'joined the party. It was wonderful fun.\\r\\n', '\\r\\n', '“On their return to the starting place, Dainten thought he would see\\r\\n', 'how fast they could go. He gave a harder slap of the lines. Away they\\r\\n', 'went down the gentle slope. The snow from the hind hoofs of White Feet\\r\\n', 'hit their faces and made the children laugh.

And how proud White Feet was to be of service to them!\\r\\n', '\\r\\n', '“They were going so fast as they neared the bottom of the slope that\\r\\n', 'White Feet could not keep ahead of the sled.

It was the\\r\\n', 'beginning of a new kind of service to man. As I told you before, the\\r\\n', 'hunter was away. He came home while the children were sledding on the\\r\\n', 'snow. He stepped from his boat and watched them in great surprise. And\\r\\n', 'oh, how he laughed when the sled upset! He patted White Feet and spoke\\r\\n', 'kindly to him, and he nodded his head upward and downward several\\r\\n', 'times. Then he put the harness on Blackie and tied him in front of the\\r\\n', 'little sled.\\r\\n', '\\r\\n', '“White Feet told Blackie to watch for the signal and go very carefully.\\r\\n', 'Dainten’s brother drove him. Blackie did good work. You see, he had\\r\\n', 'watched White Feet and had learned how to do as he did. Dainten’s\\r\\n', 'brother was very proud of Blackie.\\r\\n', '\\r\\n', '“After a while the hunter went to his boat. All the children and the\\r\\n', 'fawns followed him to see what he had brought from his hunting trip.\\r\\n', 'First he took out a lot of ducks, some geese, and a swan. Then he\\r\\n', 'unloaded a great many brown and white ptarmigan. His wife was much\\r\\n', 'pleased when she saw that he had brought her two hair seals. She and\\r\\n', 'the children carried the birds and dragged the seals up to the tent.\\r\\n', 'But the fawns didn’t follow then. The hunter was pulling some fresh\\r\\n', 'caribou skins out of his boat.”\\r\\n', '\\r\\n', '“Oh!” cried White Sox, in excitement.\\r\\n', '\\r\\n', '“Yes,” said Mother Reindeer, “and the very first skin White Feet\\r\\n', 'smelled at was his own mother’s. The neck and hind legs were all chewed\\r\\n', 'up by the teeth of wolves. Of course he felt very badly about it. The\\r\\n', 'world seemed a lonely place to him after losing his mother. But he knew\\r\\n', 'again that a leader must not think of himself. He smelled at the other\\r\\n', 'skins. They all showed the teeth marks of wolves, and all of them were\\r\\n', 'the skins of old mothers.\\r\\n', '\\r\\n', '“White Feet knew that the old mothers were usually the weaklings of the\\r\\n', 'herd. Their death saved many fawns from being caught. Then it came to\\r\\n', 'White Feet that the death of these mothers might be the means of saving\\r\\n', 'his own little band of fawns. The hunter and his family would now have\\r\\n', 'plenty of caribou skins for the coming winter. They would not need his\\r\\n', 'and Blackie’s and those of the doe fawns.\\r\\n', '\\r\\n', '“It was while White Feet was smelling at the skins that Dainten\\r\\n', 'returned from the tent. The boy stood beside White Feet and looked at\\r\\n', 'him, just for all the world as if he understood that the poor torn skin\\r\\n', 'had belonged to White Feet’s mother. From that minute Dainten and White\\r\\n', 'Feet became lifelong friends. Dainten patted the fawn and tried to\\r\\n', 'comfort him. To White Feet a human being had taken the place of his own\\r\\n', 'dear old mother.\\r\\n', '\\r\\n', '“Later, the hunter helped the boys make better harness for White Feet\\r\\n', 'and Blackie. It was the kind now used by our herders. Instead of the\\r\\n', 'curved piece of wood for each shoulder, he used a strap of sealskin\\r\\n', 'about as broad as your ear, placing it over the left shoulder and neck\\r\\n', 'and between the fore legs. The two ends of this band were fastened to\\r\\n', 'the end of the single trace, back of the right fore leg, where they\\r\\n', 'passed under the belly band. The trace stretched from the ends of the\\r\\n', 'collar band to the sled, outside of the right hind leg.\\r\\n', '\\r\\n', '“With these harnesses the hunter trained White Feet and Blackie to\\r\\n', 'work together. He was well pleased with them and sent his five dogs\\r\\n', 'to his brother, who lived a day’s journey down the beach. The hunter\\r\\n', 'knew that it would require much of the dried meat he had put up through\\r\\n', 'the summer to feed his team dogs through the winter. His new sled deer\\r\\n', 'didn’t eat meat. That meant less work for the hunter and his wife.\\r\\n', '\\r\\n', '“Of course the hunter was anxious to try out these sled deer with a\\r\\n', 'heavy load. Luckily for White Feet and Blackie, their muscles were hard\\r\\n', 'and strong by the time the first new snow came. They had plenty of\\r\\n', 'back-fat too.

The other native\\r\\n', 'people were very much surprised to see such a load drawn by two\\r\\n', 'pastured caribou fawns.\\r\\n', '\\r\\n', '“On the following day White Feet and Blackie were so tired and stiff\\r\\n', 'that Dainten tethered them out in a good moss patch near the winter\\r\\n', 'camp. His brother and sister kept watch over them. The five doe fawns\\r\\n', 'stayed near White Feet and Blackie. The hunter made them a small corral\\r\\n', 'of alders, so that his little herd would be well protected from wolves\\r\\n', 'in the nighttime.\\r\\n', '\\r\\n', '“This hunter was a wise man. He knew that when wild caribou had been\\r\\n', 'chased for several days they became very thin and poor.

He wished to keep the little herd until they were grown up; so\\r\\n', 'he took good care of them and allowed them to rest well before he took\\r\\n', 'them back to the summer camp for another big load. You see, my son,\\r\\n', 'the fierce hunter was becoming a good herder. The taming of the fawns\\r\\n', 'had also tamed him and his family. The pastured caribou fawns were now\\r\\n', 'called reindeer.”\\r\\n', '\\r\\n', '“Did they never see any of the wild caribou again?” White Sox asked.\\r\\n', '\\r\\n', '“No, not to speak to,” Mother Reindeer said, “but they soon became\\r\\n', 'used to the ways of their human friends and were quite content. Before\\r\\n', 'the November moon was gone, all the seal oil, dried fish, and meat\\r\\n', 'had been hauled from the spit to the winter camp. The hunter had more\\r\\n', 'than enough food stored up for his family; so he gave his attention to\\r\\n', 'studying the ways and habits of caribou and taking care of his first\\r\\n', 'little herd of reindeer.\\r\\n', '\\r\\n', '“On clear days, and on nights when the moon was shining, he had the\\r\\n', 'children take turns at watching the herd while it grazed. He took the\\r\\n', 'sharp claws of the big Oogarook seals and fastened them to the ends of\\r\\n', 'pieces of alder, about as big as your hoof. These made fine rakes or\\r\\n', 'moss scratchers. The children used these scratchers for digging moss,\\r\\n', 'which they put inside the corral for the fawns to eat on stormy days\\r\\n', 'and dark nights. The first herder was a thoughtful man; he didn’t want\\r\\n', 'his herd to grow thin and poor.”\\r\\n', '\\r\\n', '“He was more thoughtful than some of our herders that Uncle Slim tells\\r\\n', 'about,” said White Sox.\\r\\n', '\\r\\n', 'Mother Reindeer nodded her head. “The first herder and his family had\\r\\n', 'become so fond of their reindeer that they all seemed like one family,”\\r\\n', 'she said. “The human beings couldn’t understand the caribou language,\\r\\n', 'but White Feet and his band soon came to understand many native\\r\\n', 'words.

My mother was a beautiful spotted reindeer,\\r\\n', 'and my father was a great leader of a band of wild caribou. When I was\\r\\n', 'a fawn, all the members of our family were roped and hobbled. We were\\r\\n', 'taken on board a big floating corral and brought across the waters\\r\\n', 'to a place some thirty days’ journey from here. That floating corral\\r\\n', 'was a long, narrow, smoky, noisy, quivering thing that moved over the\\r\\n', 'surface of the waters toward the rising sun.

For two suns there was no land anywhere in sight—nothing but\\r\\n', 'water and fog, water and fog. We didn’t know what the herders were\\r\\n', 'going to do to us.

The sea was frozen over. We were\\r\\n', 'on it two days and nights. Our sleds could not haul enough moss to feed\\r\\n', 'the entire herd.

After we\\r\\n', 'left the ice, our way lay across a mountainous country. When we had\\r\\n', 'crossed that, wolves scented us and followed us many nights.

There we found many floating corrals among\\r\\n', 'the ice and many strange men in houses. Then came the most terrible\\r\\n', 'part of it all.

Together they\\r\\n', 'reasoned it out that the men had no other kind of food, and that we had\\r\\n', 'been brought there to keep that great herd of men from starving. Spot\\r\\n', 'was a sled deer—”\\r\\n', '\\r\\n', '“I thought you said she was my grandmother,” White Sox broke in. “Did\\r\\n', 'the reindeer mothers have to draw sleds after the big killing?”\\r\\n', '\\r\\n', '“Spot did,” said Mother Reindeer. “Your Uncle Slim was a fawn then.
